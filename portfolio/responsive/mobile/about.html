            <h1>About</h1>

            <h2>Who am I?</h2>

            <p>Lives in Copenhagen. Goes by the name Celia, but sometimes also Cecilie, Cille, Delia, Silja, and Cenia.</p>

            <p>Almost Bachelor of Arts in Asian Studies (China Studies). A student at University of Copenhagen for a number of years. Was also an exchange student at both Peking University and University of Hong Kong. It was in Hong Kong that I realized, that I wanted to work in a creative environment. I eventually dropped out of university to pursue my dream.</p>

            <p>Copenhagen School of Design and Technology (KEA) is my new home. Multimedia Design and Communication is what I do. Design is what I love! </p>

            <h3>What interests me the most?</h3>

            <p>I have a special interest in East Asia. This means that juicy dumplings, sweet bubble tea, and Studio Ghibli films are some of my favorite things. Apart from living in Hong Kong and Beijing, I have also travelled to Japan and South Korea.</p>

            <p>I have a lifelong passion for games and a love for independent games. I like weird electronic music. I also like to draw, but I need to practice more. I adore everything Pusheen. I mostly follow friends, cats and artists on Instagram.</p>
